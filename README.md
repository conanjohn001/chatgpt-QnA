To create a "to do list" React app, you can follow these general steps:

Create a new React app using create-react-app command or a similar tool. You can follow the instructions in the official React documentation to get started: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

Create a new component for the to-do list, which will render the list items and handle user input. You can create a new file TodoList.js in the src folder and define the component as follows:

*code in note file*

In this component, we use the useState hook to manage the state of the to-do list items and the input field for new items. We define two event handlers for the input field: handleNewTodoChange to update the state of the input value, and handleNewTodoSubmit to add the new item to the list and reset the input value.

Import the TodoList component in your App.js file and render it in your app:

*code in note file*

Run your app using npm start or a similar command, and you should see the to-do list component rendered in your browser.
You can customize the styling and functionality of your to-do list app further based on your specific requirements and preferences. You can refer to the official React documentation and other resources online for more advanced concepts and techniques.
